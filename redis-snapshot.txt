Its not reckommended to use default persistence settings in Prod environment.
Resource usage spike happens during snapshotting.

Always commentout SAVE conf in config file & use BGSAVE.
BGSAVE cann't be configured in conf file, so needs to setup a CRON to run BGSAVE periodically.

Difference between SAVE & BGSAVE. 

  ==> SAVE blocks while BGSAVE doesn't
  ==> SAVE can be configured in redis.config, BGSAVE can't be configured.

If the redis server is already in production with default configuration, SAVE config can be changed 
with CONFIG SET command.

To remove all SAVE options, run CONFIG SET "".
To update this change in redis.config file , run CONFIG REWRITE( supported from redis 2.8).
